<b>Requirements (Instruments, Chemicals & Other): </b><br>

· Optical or compound microscope (with calibration facility)<br>
· Stage micrometer (for calibration)<br>
· Eyepiece graticule or image analysis software<br>
· Glass slides and cover slips<br>
· Fine powder sample<br>
· Spatula or fine brush<br>
· Dropper and distilled water (for dispersion, if required)<br>
· Tissue paper<br>
· Notebook and pencil<br>
 
<b>Procedure: </b><br>
1. Calibrate the microscope using a stage micrometer to determine the value of each eyepiece division in micrometers.<br>
2. Focus the microscope properly and record the calibration factor.<br>
3. Spread a small, uniform amount of powder sample on a clean glass slide.<br>
4. If particles are agglomerated, add a drop of distilled water or dispersing liquid using a dropper.<br>
5. Place a cover slip carefully, avoiding air bubbles.<br>
6. Place the slide on the microscope stage and focus under low magnification, then switch to higher magnification for measurement.<br>
7. Measure the particle diameter using the calibrated eyepiece or digital software.<br>
8. Record at least 50–100 readings for accuracy.<br>
9. Group the data into size ranges (e.g., 0–10 µm, 10–20 µm, etc.) and note the frequency of particles in each group.<br>
10. Plot a histogram or frequency curve of particle size distribution.<br>
11. Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the distribution.<br>
12. Comment on the distribution type — whether it is narrow, broad, uniform, or skewed.<br>
