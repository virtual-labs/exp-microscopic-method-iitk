1.	Replace the eyepiece of the microscope with the eyepiece micrometer.<br>
2.	Place the stage micrometer on the stage of the microscope and focus the scale under 10 x using coarse adjustment and fine adjustment knobs.<br>
3.	Make necessary adjustments so that the two scales are superimposed over one another.<br>
4.	Now rotate the nose piece of the microscope and focus the scale under 45 x magnification using fine adjustment knob only. Make necessary adjustments so that the two scales are parallel and superimposed over each other. Adjust the light condenser so that two scales are visible clearly. <br>
5.	Search for points of coincidence where the eyepiece division and stage division coincide perfectly. Let them be X and Y.<br>
6.	Find the number of divisions between X and Y on the stage and eyepiece micrometer.<br>
7.	From the distance between X and Y on stage micrometer and number of divisions between X and Y on eyepiece micrometer find the length of each division on the eyepiece micrometer.
