### Introduction<br>
According to Microscopic method, an emulsion or suspension, diluted or undiluted, is mounted on a slide or ruled cell and placed on a mechanical stage. Eye piece micrometer has a small scale on it. The scale has to be calibrated using a stage micrometer. Stage micrometer is a glass slide having a scale on it. The scale is 1 mm in length, and is divided into 100 parts. The smallest division on the stage micrometer is 0.01 mm or 10 Âµm in length.
The exact value of each division on the eyepiece micrometer varies with every optical combination. Hence it should be calibrated with the stage micrometer for every optical combination.
If we want to measure the particle size under 45 x magnifications, calibration of eyepiece micrometer should be done at 45 x magnification. If particle size is measured under 10 x magnifications, calibration is to be done under 10 x. 
In the present experiment the calibration of eyepiece micrometer is done under 45 x magnifications.<br>
### Advantages: <br>
1. It allows the observer to view the particle.<br>
2. Preparation of sample is simple and easy.<br>
### Disadvantages:    <br>
1. Method is slow and tedious.<br>
2. Diameter is obtained from two dimensions. i.e., length and breadth.<br>
3. Depth of particle is not measurable.
